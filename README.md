# Optimizing Animal Shelter Operations to Minimize Euthanasia

## Overview

Many animals are euthanized in shelters due to overcrowding and limited resources. This project explores optimization strategies to improve animal welfare by minimizing unnecessary euthanasia through better resource allocation, shelter cooperation, and adoption incentives.

## Motivation

Animal welfare is a vital indicator of societal maturity in a sustainable society. However, shelters often face:

- Limited physical capacity  
- Inadequate budgets  
- Poor infrastructure growth despite increasing stray animals  
- Difficulties in inter-shelter cooperation  

As a result, healthy animals may be euthanized unnecessarily. This project addresses these challenges through data-driven models and collaborative strategies.

## Key Concepts

### Capacity for Care (C4C)

- A shelter management model that calculates the **optimal daily population** based on housing quality and adoption targets.
- Associated with:
  - Lower shelter populations  
  - Higher adoption rates  
  - Reduced euthanasia

### Logistic Regression Model

- Predicts the **probability of adoption** based on factors like:
  - Age  
  - Sex  
  - Coat color  
  - Reasons for relinquishment

### Free Adoption Strategy

- Promoting **fee waivers** during overcrowding periods helps increase adoption rates.

## Problem & Optimization Model

### Main Issues:

- **Saturation of shelter capacity**  
- **Minimum-budget operations**, leading to inevitable euthanasia  
- **Lack of inter-shelter communication**  

### Solutions:

- Reduce stray animal population through policy and education  
- Encourage a public perception shift towards companion animals  
- Enact laws against excessive breeding  
- **Optimize shelter capacity usage** through:
  - **Animal transfers between shelters**  
  - **Information sharing systems**

### Proposed Optimization:

- Mathematical models to determine optimal operations that **minimize euthanasia**  
- Redistribution of animals from overcrowded to under-capacity shelters  
- Incorporation of adoption incentives (e.g., waived fees, media campaigns)

## Prediction

- **Significant reduction in euthanasia** when combining:
  - Shelter capacity increases  
  - Strategic animal transfers  
- Importance of **adoption promotion** to sustain improvements  
- Highlighted the need for:
  - Real-time data systems  
  - Transparent inter-shelter communication  
  - Consideration of **stress and psychological impacts** on both animals and staff

## Conclusion

This project presents a holistic approach combining:

- Mathematical optimization  
- Adoption encouragement  
- Shelter collaboration

When adopted together, these strategies lead to **effective euthanasia reduction** and **enhanced animal welfare**.
